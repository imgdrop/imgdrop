# Privacy Policy

Image Drop is a completely client-side tool. What this means is that your images are safely decoded on your computer with the power of modern web technologies. **Your images are never uploaded to any Image Drop servers**.

Along with this, the developers make sure that personal information, including IP addresses and file names, **are never tracked**. We do, however, collect small amounts of data for analytics and debugging purposes to improve your experience.

## Data we (Developers of Image Drop) Collect

**[Sentry](https://sentry.io/about) is used for error tracking**. When an image fails to be converted or another error occurs, the details of the error is submitted for easier debugging. As part of the details of this error report, **your browser name, browser version and operating system name are collected**. We have disabled the IP address tracking setting in Sentry, so **your IP address is not collected**.

Sentry will also collect the logs of the web application. For this reason, the developers take special care to not log anything personal. For instance, **file names are censored when logged**. However, **the file extension and [media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) of the file is logged and thus collected**. If you believe personal information is being logged, please [open an issue](https://github.com/imgdrop/imgdrop/issues/new) and we will look into fixing it.

**We currently do not use any other services for tracking.**
